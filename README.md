Hi 👋, I'm Sashank, a Computer Science graduate from NYU. I have a passion for developing scalable tech solutions to tackle complex problems

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: TensorFlow, SHAP, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, PySpark, Flask, React, Node.js, Express
- **Data Tools**: BigQuery, Hadoop, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Looker
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, Jira

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- **Fraud Detection at Scale**: Developing machine learning models and generating rules for **fraud detection** 
- **Open Source Contributions**: 

## 🌱 What I’m Learning
- **Deep Learning**: I am continuously expanding my knowledge of **deep learning** models, focusing on advanced architectures like **transformers**, **LSTMs**, and **CNNs**. I aim to apply these models in domains like **NLP**, **computer vision**, and **recommendation systems**.
  
- **Recommendation Systems**: Currently, I’m learning about **recommendation algorithms** such as **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, **hybrid approaches**, and how to build scalable, production-ready systems for personalized recommendations.
  
- **Backend Development**:
  - Exploring **scalable architectures** and **RESTful APIs**.
  - Diving deeper into **gRPC**, **microservices**, and backend frameworks like **Django** and **Flask**.
  - Enhancing my skills in **database optimization** and **asynchronous programming** using **Celery** and **AsyncIO**.
  - Embracing **containerization** using **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for deploying applications at scale​⬤
